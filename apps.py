#App code should be put here, so as not to create an error in masonCLI.
#All apps should be written in python.
#Ploease start all apps with a def statement as well.
#EX:
#def example():
#   print("example")

#Template for addition to masonCLI:
#
#if (command == 'example'):
#   lastcommand = 'example'
#   example()
